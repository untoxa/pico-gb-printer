Based on the original webserver for the PI Pico repo: https://github.com/maxnet/pico-webserver

Webserver example that came with TinyUSB slightly modified to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
Lets the Pico pretend to be a USB Ethernet device. Runs the webinterface at http://192.168.7.1/

## Schematics

You will need a Raspberry Pi, 1/2 of the game boy link cable and a four-channel 5v to 3.3v level shifter. Connect parts as shown:

This is the example of the ready-to-use device:

As finding which is SIN and SOUT is sometimes tricky as signals are crossed within the serial cable, you can also make your own PCB with a Pi Zero and a GBC/GBA serial socket [following the guide here](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Collection-of-PCB-for-Game-Boy-Printer-Emulators). The PCBs come in two flavors: one simple and small with only one pushbutton for shutter or a larger version featuring a full remote control for Photo!

## Build dependencies

### On Debian:

```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Your Linux distribution does need to provide a recent CMake (3.13+).
If not, compile [CMake from source](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) first.

### On OSX:

```bash
brew install cmake doxygen 
brew tap ArmMbed/homebrew-formulae
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

- Install the [Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) and make sure to add the location to your path. 
### On Windows:

Windows is not a friendly system to compile the pico sdk. Unless you want to loose your precious time, use the following method:
- Install [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Ubuntu is default install) and update it
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```
- Install the pico SDK by following the ["Quick Pico Setup"](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
You can use the installation script written for Raspberry Pi, it works. Your computer may require a boot at this step.
- Continue installation like below.

## Build instructions

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/untoxa/pico-gb-printer
cd pico-gb-printer
git submodule update --init
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Copy the resulting pico_gb_printer.uf2 file to the Pi Pico mass storage device manually.
Webserver will be available at http://192.168.7.1/

## Developing the Frontend
Frontend code development requires node.js (>=20)  
* Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
* run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* run `npm run dev` to start a local dev server on [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000/). The server also does proxy the `/status.json` and `/download` endpoints from a Pico which must be connected to the same machine.
* run `npm run build` to build the static files (html/css/js). Files will be built to `./fs` 
* When building the rom file locally, also run `./regen-fsdata.sh`
