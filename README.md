Based on the original webserver for the PI Pico repo: https://github.com/maxnet/pico-webserver

Webserver example that came with TinyUSB slightly modified to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
Lets the Pico pretend to be a USB Ethernet device. Runs the webinterface at http://192.168.7.1/

## Schematics

You will need a Raspberry Pi, 1/2 of the game boy link cable and a four-channel 5v to 3.3v level shifter. Connect parts as shown:

This is the example of the ready-to-use device:

As finding which is SIN and SOUT is sometimes tricky as signals are crossed within the serial cable, you can also make your own PCB with a Pi Zero and a GBC/GBA serial socket [following the guide here](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Collection-of-PCB-for-Game-Boy-Printer-Emulators). Just [route the LED to GPIO 8](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/pico-gb-printer/blob/c10a31e7458818ecd8ce3af9a09c53344a659cd4/include/globals.h#L8C33-L8C35) and the [Pushbutton to GPIO9](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/pico-gb-printer/blob/c10a31e7458818ecd8ce3af9a09c53344a659cd4/include/globals.h#L21) to make it shine and cut paper !

## Build dependencies

### On Debian:

```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Your Linux distribution does need to provide a recent CMake (3.13+).
If not, compile [CMake from source](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) first.

### On Windows:

Windows is not a friendly system to compile the pico sdk. Unless you want to loose your precious time, use the following method:
- Install [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Ubuntu is default install) and update it
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```
- Install the pico SDK by following the ["Quick Pico Setup"](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
You can use the installation script written for Raspberry Pi, it works. Your computer may require a boot at this step.
- Continue installation like below.

## Build instructions

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/untoxa/pico-gb-printer
cd pico-gb-printer
git submodule update --init
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Copy the resulting pico_gb_printer.uf2 file to the Pi Pico mass storage device manually.
Webserver will be available at http://192.168.7.1/

Content it is serving is in /fs
If you change any files there, run ./regen-fsdata.sh
